     * The size of a TV screen always refers to its diagonal measurement. 
     * For example, a 40-inch TV screen is 40 inches diagonally, from one 
     * corner on top to the other corner on bottom. The old TV screens had 
     * a width-to-height aspect ratio of 4: 3, which means that for every 3 
     * inches in TV screen height, there were 4 inches in TV screen width. 
     * Today, most TV screens have a width-to-height aspect ratio of 16: 9, 
     * which means that for every 9 inches in TV screen height there are 
     * 16 inches in TV screen width. Using these aspect ratios and the 
     * Pythagorean Theorem, you can easily determine that: 
     * for all 4: 3 TVs 
     * Width = Diagonal × 0.8 
     * Height = Diagonal × 0.6 
     * 
     * for all 16: 9 TVs 
     * Width = Diagonal × 0.87 
     * Height = Diagonal × 0.49 
     * 
     * Write a Java program that displays the following menu: 
     * 4/ 3 TV Screen 
     * 16/ 9 TV Screen 
     * Exit 
     * 
     * and prompts the user to enter a choice as well as the diagonal screen 
     * size in inches. Then, the Java program must display the width and the 
     * height of the TV screen. This process must continue repeatedly, until 
     * the user selects choice 3 (Exit) from the menu.
