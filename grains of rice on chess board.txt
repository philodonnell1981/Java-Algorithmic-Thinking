    There is a myth about a poor man who invented chess. The King of India was so pleased with that new game that he offered to give 
    the poor man anything he wished for. The poor but wise man told his King that he would like one grain of rice for the first 
    square of the board, two grains for the second, four grains for the third and so on, doubled for each of the 64 squares of the 
    game board. This seemed to the King to be a modest request, so he ordered his servants to bring the rice. 
    Write a Java program that calculates and displays how many grains of rice, and how many pounds of rice, will be on the chessboard 
    in the end. Suppose that one pound of rice contains Â  about 30,000 grains of rice.

      rice *= 2;

    System.out.println("at a weight of " + lb + " pounds");
