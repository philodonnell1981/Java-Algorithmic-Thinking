     * the name of each team and the letter 
     * “W” for win, “L” for loss, or “T” for tie (draw) for each game.

     * team won, lost, or tied respectively. 
     * For example, if the user enters “L”, the Java program must search and display, 
     * for each team, the week numbers (e.g., Week 3, Week 14, and so on) 
     * in which the team lost the game.
