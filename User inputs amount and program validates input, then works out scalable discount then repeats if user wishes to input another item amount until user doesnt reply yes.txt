     * Write a Java program that calculates and displays the 
     * discount that a customer receives based on the amount 
     * of his or her order, according to the following table:
     *     Amount     Discount
     * $ 0 < amount < $ 20 - 0% 
     * $ 20 <= amount < $ 50 - 3% 
     * $ 50 <= amount < $ 100 - 5% 
     * $ 100 <= amount  - 10% 
     * 
     * At the end of each discount calculation, the program must ask the 
     * user if he or she wishes to calculate the discount of another amount. 
     * If the answer is “yes”, the program must repeat; it must end otherwise. 
     * Make your program accept the answer in all possible forms such as 
     * “yes”, “YES”, “Yes”, or even “YeS”. 
     * Moreover, using a loop control structure the program must validate 
     * data input and display an error message when the user enters any 
     * non-positive value for amount.
