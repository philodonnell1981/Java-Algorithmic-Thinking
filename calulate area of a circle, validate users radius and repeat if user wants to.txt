     * Write a Java program that prompts the user to enter the length 
      of the radius of a circle and then calculates and displays its area. 
      The program must iterate as many times as the user wishes. 
      At the end of each area calculation, the program must ask the user 
      if he or she wishes to calculate the area of another circle. 
      If the answer is “yes” the program must repeat; it must end otherwise. 
      Make your program accept the answer in all possible forms such as 
      “yes”, “YES”, “Yes”, or even “YeS”. 
      Moreover, using a loop control structure, the program must validate 
      data input and display an error message when the user enters any 
      non-positive value for Radius. Hint: Use the Math.PI constant to get the value of π.
