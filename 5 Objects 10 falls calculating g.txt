     * On Earth, a free-falling object has an 
     * acceleration of 9.81 m/s2 downward. 
     * This value is denoted by g. A student wants 
     * to calculate that value using an experiment. 
     * She allows five different objects to fall downward 
     * from a known height and measures the time they need 
     * to reach the floor. She does this 10 times for each object. 
     * Then, using a formula she calculates g for each object, 
     * for each fall. But since her chronometer is not so accurate, 
     * she needs a Java program that lets her enter all calculated 
     * values of g in a 5 Ã— 10 array and then, it calculates and displays 
     * a.for each object, the average value of g (per fall) 
     * b.for each fall, the average value of g (per object) 
     * c.the overall average value of g
