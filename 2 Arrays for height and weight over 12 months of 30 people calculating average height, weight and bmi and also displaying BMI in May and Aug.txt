    /* The Body Mass Index (BMI) is often used to 
     * determine whether a person is overweight or 
     * underweight for his or her height. The formula 
     * used to calculate BMI is: 
     * weight (lbs) x 703 / height(inches squared)
     * Write a Java program that lets the user enter into two arrays the 
     * weight (in pounds) and height (in inches) of 30 
     * people, measured on a monthly basis, for a period 
     * of one year (January to December). 
     * The program must then calculate and display 
     * a.for each person, his or her average weight, average height, and average BMI 
     * b.for each person, his or her BMI in May and in August 
     * Please note that all people are adults but some of them are between the ages of 18 and 25. 
     * This means they may still grow taller, thus their height might be different each month!
