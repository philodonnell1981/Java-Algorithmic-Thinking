/*
A public opinion polling company asks 1000 citizens if they eat breakfast in the morning. 
Write a Java program that prompts the citizens to enter their gender (M for Male, F for Female) 
and their answer to the question (Y for Yes, N for No, S for Sometimes), and then calculates 
and displays the number of citizens that gave “Yes” as an answer, as well as the percentage of 
women among the citizens that gave “No” as an answer. Using a loop control structure, the program 
must also validate data input and accept only values M or F for gender and Y, N, or S for answer.
